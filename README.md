A useful JSX Script for web developers, which can be executed in "Adobe Photoshop" to export PSD-images to HTML.

The script creates an HTML-file which contains the layers as absolutely positioned DIV-elements.

The exporter tries to adapt the text-formatting by using CSS, but not all options are supported at the moment.

Non-text-layers are stored as PNG-images and loaded into the HTML as "background-image"s.
